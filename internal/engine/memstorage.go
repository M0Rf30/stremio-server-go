// In-RAM, bounded torrent storage backend (opt-in).
//
// This file implements a storage.ClientImplCloser that keeps piece data in
// memory instead of on disk, bounded by a single byte budget shared across all
// torrents. It lets the server stream without ever writing piece data to disk
// (mobile / Termux / low-disk / HuggingFace), mirroring Elementum's sliding RAM
// window. It is enabled only when Config.MemoryCacheSize > 0; the default path
// keeps storage.NewFileByInfoHash unchanged.
//
// Mechanism (proven against anacrolix/torrent v1.61.0):
//
// The backend combines two cooperating bounds that anacrolix is explicitly
// designed to support for capacity-limited storage:
//
//  1. Request bounding via TorrentImpl.Capacity. We hand anacrolix a single
//     shared *func() (cap int64, capped bool) returning (budget, true). The
//     request strategy (internal/request-strategy/order.go GetRequestablePieces)
//     walks pieces in priority order, subtracts each piece length from the
//     remaining capacity, and stops once the budget is exhausted. Because the
//     order is keyed on reader proximity, only the highest-priority pieces that
//     fit in the budget are ever requested; as a reader advances, the window
//     slides forward. Sharing one Capacity pointer across torrents makes the
//     budget global (torrent-piece-request-order.go keys the shared request
//     order on the Capacity pointer).
//
//  2. A hard byte cap enforced by this storage via LRU eviction of COMPLETE
//     pieces. On a write that would exceed the budget we free the least-
//     recently-accessed complete piece(s): drop the buffer and flip the piece
//     to not-complete. ReadAt updates recency, so recently-read pieces are
//     retained and already-played pieces are evicted first.
//
// Concurrency model:
//
//   - Piece bytes are guarded by a per-piece RWMutex (memPiece.mu), so reads and
//     writes of different pieces — in particular of different torrents — never
//     contend, and a ReadAt copies under its own piece's read lock only.
//   - The budget (used) and the eviction order (an LRU min-heap of the complete
//     pieces) are guarded by one store-wide mutex (memStorage.mu). It is taken
//     only for the rare accounting events: first write into a piece, completion,
//     eviction, torrent close. ReadAt and chunk WriteAt never take it.
//   - Lock order is allocMu -> memStorage.mu -> memPiece.mu. A piece lock is a
//     leaf with respect to the other two: it is never held while acquiring
//     either of them.
//   - Read recency is an atomic stamp (memPiece.lastUsed); the heap keeps a
//     lower bound of it per piece and refreshes a stale key only when the piece
//     surfaces as the eviction candidate, so a read costs no heap operation and
//     eviction is O(log n) amortised instead of a scan over every piece.
//
// Correctness — we never serve wrong or stale bytes:
//
//   - A non-resident piece reports Completion{Ok: true, Complete: false}, and its
//     ReadAt returns (0, errPieceEvicted), never (0, nil) — the storage.Piece /
//     storagePieceReader wrappers panic on a (0, nil) read.
//   - Evicting bytes is NOT enough on its own: anacrolix only clears a piece's
//     dirty-chunk bitmap on hash *failure*, never on completion, so a completed
//     piece keeps reading as "have" (reader.available stays > 0). reader.readAt
//     then spin-retries the failing read forever (a stack overflow) instead of
//     blocking, because it never sees the piece as unavailable. To close this we
//     drive a real re-download: ReadAt on an evicted piece calls the refetch hook
//     (wired by the manager to Torrent.Piece(i).VerifyData), which re-hashes the
//     empty piece, fails, clears its dirty chunks, and re-requests it — so the
//     reader blocks for the re-download. The hook returns a channel closed once
//     that re-pend has landed; the evicted read waits for it (instead of polling
//     on a fixed sleep) and returns, so anacrolix's next attempt sees the piece
//     as unavailable and blocks until it is downloaded. The wait is capped by
//     refetchBackoff, and repeated evicted reads of the same piece are throttled
//     by an escalating floor, so anacrolix's retry recursion stays bounded even
//     when the re-pend never lands. The hasher's own read of the evicted piece
//     goes through WriteTo, which fails fast without waiting on itself.
//   - We only ever evict COMPLETE pieces, so in-flight (partially written)
//     pieces are never dropped and anacrolix's chunk bookkeeping is never
//     invalidated mid-download.
//
// Bound vs. correctness: if every resident piece is still in-flight (rare; the
// Capacity request bound keeps the in-flight set small), eviction may find no
// complete victim and resident bytes briefly exceed the budget rather than
// dropping live data. This is the deliberate conservative direction — correct
// bytes always, with at most the bounded in-flight working set as overage.
